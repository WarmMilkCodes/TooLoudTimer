# TooLoudTimer
Audio-based timer application that monitors ambient noise levels through the microphone. The timer starts when the noise exceeds a configurable threshold and pauses when it drops below. Designed for classrooms, meetings, or focus environments, the app encourages maintaining quiet by tracking cumulative noisy periods.
