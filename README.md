# Too Loud Timer

**Too Loud Timer** is an interactive application that combines real-time audio monitoring with a timer to track noisy periods. Designed for teachers, students, or anyone managing a quiet environment, it starts a timer when noise exceeds a threshold and pauses when the environment becomes quiet. A dynamic frequency visualization adds a visual representation of the noise levels.
